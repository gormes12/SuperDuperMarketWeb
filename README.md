# Introduction
 The cost of living is a significant economic burden on more and more people in the world. One of the means to alleviate the cost of living is the ability to check and
compare prices in a convenient and easy way, which allows for wise consumer purchase of any basket of products.

 The development of the world and technology makes it possible to bring together sellers (Stores) and shoppers, and create a digital arena in which the consumer can,
on the one hand, make quick and easy price comparisons, and on the other hand, create exposure of stores to different consumers who were previously unaware of their
existence.

SDMarket allows you to set up stores that sell various items and will allow the consumer to order these items, while the system performs the ideal price comparison
according to the consumer's requirements.
